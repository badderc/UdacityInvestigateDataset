# Udacity Project 1
## Intro to Data Analysis: Investigate a Dataset
As part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated findings about it.

## Premise
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of No Show patients in Brazil in order to understand trends in the patients who did or did not show up for their appointments.

## Data
The data comes from the Kaggle Medical Appointment No Shows dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments. 

## Tools and Skills
* pandas, numpy, matplotlib
* Typical data analysis workflow
* Communicating results based on analysis
